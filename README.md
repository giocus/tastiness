TAStiNESs HTML ui for NES TAS videos
=========

Some code taken from [tom7](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom7/)'s cool project: [learnfun & playfun: A general technique for automating NES games](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom7/mario/)

After learning about tom7's project, it prompted me to spend some time on a personal project that I've thought of off and on for some years, around automatically finding optimal speed runs for games.

I always thought the concept was more of an "I guess it's technically possible, but not feasible" idea...  Tom7's casual mention that the NES has only 2KB of ram changes the idea to "perhaps it's slightly feasible".

As phase 1 of the project, I made this web UI to fceux
